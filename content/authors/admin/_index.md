Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at Lehigh University advised by [Prof. Cristian-Ioan Vasile](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/faculty/cristian-ioan-vasile). I am interested in perception-aware planning and control with user preferences for autonomous robots with safety and correctness guarantees. 

Before embarking on my journey at Lehigh, I was a visiting research intern at the [Intelligent Manipulation Lab](https://intmanlab.com/index.html), University of Lincoln, UK where I got the opportunity to work on planning and control for human-robot shared manipulation.

*My research vision centers on developing the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of intelligent robotic systems for complex, safety-critical applications with an emphasis on informed decision-making.*

[Here](https://dishakamale.github.io/robotics/uploads/resume.pdf) is my professional summary.
