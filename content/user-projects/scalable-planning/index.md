title: A∗-based Planning with Relaxation over Large City-scale Environments
summary: An efficient A∗-based planning framework for temporal logic tasks with user preferences for relaxation in large robot environments. We propose a novel progress-based heuristics that improves the search and runtime performance by tens of orders of magnitude over large city-sized graphs containing over a hundred thousand nodes and over a million edges.
