<!-- This work presents a novel approach to control synthesis for homogeneous multi-robot teams, combining temporal logic specifications with formal user preferences for specification relaxation.

## Key Features

- Specification relaxation through Weighted Finite-state Edit Systems
- Hybrid synthesis approach combining:
