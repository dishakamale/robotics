<!-- This paper introduces an automata-based framework for planning with relaxed specifications, incorporating user preferences and flexible task modifications.

## Key Features

- Weighted finite state edit systems for specification relaxation
- Three-way product automaton construction
- Bi-objective optimization balancing:
  - Temporal relaxation of deadlines
  - Task modification/deletion
- Complex constraints on task ordering and grouping

## Technical Framework

### Specification Relaxation
- Permissible operations on specifications
  - Task substitution
  - Task deletion
  - Order modifications
  - Group constraints

### Three-way Product Automaton
The framework combines:
1. Robot motion planning
2. Specification satisfaction
3. Available relaxations

This unified approach enables:
- Minimal relaxation policy computation
- Efficient shortest path algorithms
- Comprehensive solution space exploration

## Implementation

The system provides:
1. Runtime performance optimization
2. Flexible task modification
3. Deadline management
4. Complex constraint handling

## Applications

The framework is particularly suitable for:
- Robot task planning
- Dynamic environment adaptation
- User preference integration
- Multi-objective optimization scenarios

## Results

Our case study demonstrates:
- Efficient runtime performance
- Multiple relaxation modalities
- Practical applicability
- Balanced optimization outcomes -->
