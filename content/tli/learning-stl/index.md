title: "Learning Optimal Signal Temporal Logic Decision Trees for Classification: A Max-Flow MILP Formulation"
summary: "Given a labeled time-series data, this work aims at learning the underlying Signal Temporal Logic Formulae that specifies the behavior. The proposed approach created a decision tree for a two-class and multi-class classification problem and finds a globally optimal solution."
